Code Review Checklist
talk AI, people perspectives it. group people, knowledge potential AI, solution problems world facing today. group people threatened thought taking world.
birth Turing 1950 thought “Can machines think?”. 1980s, adoption “expert systems” companies world, booming initiated. Initially, matter awe results achieve. AI’s growth past decades exponential transformed live, work solve challenges. made impact wide variety areas including healthcare, education, business more. But, areas highest impact made recently environment climate change.
Revolutionizing Environment Climate Change?
strengthen climate predictions, enable smarter decision-making decarbonising industries building transport, work allocate renewable energy. recent years, game-changer people, organizations, climate change. Microsoft believes artificial intelligence, encompassing machine learning deep learning, “game-changer” climate change environmental issues. company’s ‘AI Earth’ program committed $50 years create test applications AI.
increasingly manage intermittency renewable energy incorporated grid; handle fluctuations improve energy storage well. Wind companies turbine’s propeller produce electricity rotation incorporating real-time weather operational data.
improve energy efficiency scale incorporating data meters Internet Things (the internet computing devices embedded everyday objects, enabling send receive data) forecast energy demand. Besides, artificial intelligence systems simulate potential zoning laws, building ordinances, plains planning disaster preparedness. vision sustainable create “urban dashboard” consisting real-time data energy water availability, traffic weather make cities energy-efficient livable.
Hotter temperatures significant impacts agriculture well. Data sensors monitor crop moisture, soil composition temperature improve production crops watering. Incorporating information drones, monitor conditions, increasingly automatic systems times plant, spray harvest crops, diseases problems. result increased efficiency, enhanced yields, water, fertilizer pesticides.
But, downside?
talk effect environment climate, coin elucidated. So, positives discussed above, usage downside.
year’s World Economic Forum report showed address Earth’s environmental challenges, important manage properly. forum experts field, potential accelerate environmental degradation. power-intensive GPUs run machine learning training cited contributing increased C02 emissions.
half century, question environmental impact – ethical issues – arising techniques developed decades combination explosion data computational power.
advances enabled artificial intelligence, speech recognition self-driving cars, systems consume lot generate volumes climate-changing carbon emissions.
study found training off-the-shelf language-processing system produced 1,400 emissions – amount produced flying roundtrip Francisco. ways make machine learning cleaner greener, movement called “Green AI.” algorithms power-hungry others, example, training moved remote locations renewable sources.
key, however, developers companies machine learning experiments spewing volumes reduced.
done?
prevent this, proposition World Economic Forum report advancements “safe” pursued, ensure humanity developing harmful environment. Specifically, World Economic Forum report developers “must incorporate health natural environment fundamental dimension.” safeguarding models demand consumption energy natural resources sustainable, factors. sense, programs designed dimension environmental protection improvement mind.
future development programs, important note environmental impact creating systems place. academic study energy usage deep learning processes, creation effective costly environment. 300,000 kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent emissions created process training single model. basically equal emissions average cars United States. negative environmental impact addition positive implications climate change crucial, moving forward.
room improvement, pioneers machine learning recently published paper called Tackling Climate Change Machine Learning discussed conference. Rolnick, postdoctoral fellow University “call arms” bring researchers together.
paper covers areas research machine learning used, including energy production, CO2 removal, education, solar geoengineering, finance more. idea build energy-efficient buildings, creating low-carbon materials, tech monitoring deforestation greener transportation sources. Artificial intelligence machine learning medium work caretaker mother earth.
forecasting climate change?
kick start climate informatics 2011 regulates collaboration data science climate science. covers wide topics improving prediction extreme events hurricanes, paleoclimatology, collecting data ice cores, climate up-down scaling impact us.
“There’s lot uncertainty,” Monteleoni
Monteleoni, computer science professor University concludes AI/ ML models generally forecast short-term. significant difference long-term forecasting.
system developed Princeton 1960s. AI/ ML models developed till revolve atmosphere, oceans, land, cryosphere ice. achieve heights amount data collected point time, compute complex climate conditions climate modeling algorithms.
showing effects extreme weather?
climate change rise atmospheric temperature proof, make realistic, Montreal Institute Learning Algorithms (MILA), Microsoft ConscientAI Labs Generative Adversarial Networks popularly GANs simulate mother earth rising levels, atmospheric temperature, air pollution intensive storms.
“Our goal convince people climate change real, it’s people that,” Schmidt, co-author paper Ph.D. candidate
project deployed people places future significant climate change.
track carbon emissions?
answer, yes. Tracking carbon emission agendas UN. 2020, UN’s goal prevent coal plants built. Satellite images picture deep learning techniques, data science researchers analyze quality satellite images track emission. Google expanding horizon nonprofit’s satellite imagery, including gas-powered plants emissions researchers track pollution. countries organizations govern CO2 emission ground level data unreachable global monitoring associations.
automate analysis images plants regular updates emissions. introduces ways measure plant’s impact, crunching nearby infrastructure electricity use. That’s beneficial gas-powered plants don’t easy-to-measure plumes coal-powered plants have.
provide intelligence, accelerate innovation implement technology extraordinary breadth depth global insights big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, information management organizations combining unique, specialist services high-lvel human expertise.
