Human minds, fascination carrying potential tinkering nature pixie dust intelligence, creating solving mysteries wonders admiration. However, matter captivating human mind be, appalled. hunger more, unravel limitations, pure greed. Humans stopped evolving intelligence makes supreme.
Intelligence calls supremacy so, evolve opposed challenge human minds, capabilities making question importance themselves? Artificial Intelligence revolution, havoc light. concept making machines work own, granting machines –The Intelligence.
idea making machines work humans 19s. people didn’t thing making non-living thing work, think, tasks own, mention, surpass humans skills. facts did. 1997. greatest chess player, Kasparov defeated chess game machine exactly, top skilled human lost mere machine created could’ve defeated him. power, betterment, skills, granted supremacy. Machines tools? Equipment? helped unskilled mind intelligence creates skilled work perfection precision? initially was, however, time passed humans drawn puzzle AI, lot changed. Human research deeper deeper result, machines evolved it.
present, & Machines growing field. develops improves, part industrial revolution. industries, laborious work care humans replaced machines. Naturally, evolution machines, precision, mass productivity, quality control, time efficiencies, factors made choice. choice humans.
led fear, fear not-so-distant future, future machines evolved they’ll human employee leading unemployment. population increase world, tech threat labor market. again… it? oppose threat? adapting technology make millions people lose jobs? lead mass unemployment? machines surpass humans? Will, creation creator?
matter fearful future seem, reality, scary. Truth present reality, holds unlock level human evolution. Technology growing. time technology idea, today idea implemented, it’s working carried out. stop advancement growth Artificial Intelligence, it’s wave flowing present generation generations learn, learn swim flow avoid drowning.
jobs replaced machines, evolves it’ll challenging human minds skills. present COVID 19 situation, contactless cashiers robots delivering packages usual routine tasks. jobs Secretaries, Schedulers, book-keeper risk too. Manufacturing units, agriculture, food services, retail, transportation & logistic, hospitality part AI-affected automation. estimation, 20 jobs, including manufacturing lost robots. AI, robotics, 3D printing, genetics make in, architects, medical docs, composers feel threatened technology. Making question jobs too? terrifying.
However, machines replacing jobs, they’ll creating jobs. economic growth, innovation, investment 133 jobs generated. newly enhanced jobs create benefits amplify one’s creativity, strategy, entrepreneurial skills. catch?
Well, it’s skills. creating 3 times jobs destroying, it’s skills count. surged job opportunities, opportunities Senior Data Scientist, Mobile Application Developer, SEO specialist. jobs it’s born, however, jobs qualification, high-level skills acquire skills expensive time-consuming task. future generation struggle faced present generations. It’s vulnerability skill gap unemployment youths crushed most.
Therefore, advancement inevitable remains choice adapt, learn, equip it. companies work build AI-ready workplace. collaborate government, educators, non-profit organizations work bring policies understand technologies’ impacts faster providing employees security. economic business planning made considerable minimizing impact local jobs properly maximizing opportunities.
employees provided proper tools opportunities acquiring AI-based skills day-to-day work. skills identified implemented upskilling continual learning initiatives. Employees maximize Robotic Quotient learn skills. They’ll adapt working models understand roles coming future.
Howsoever, it’s totally control, proves choice, limitations present. First, it’s expensive, secondly, manufacturing machines bulk environment. Machines maintenance, human labor cheaper considered machines. Underdeveloped countries find hard equip people upskilling reskilling required workplace play role countries, years. risky unethical, it’s hard figure responsible cases wrong.
matter, advanced gets, skills humans upper i.e., soft skills. Skills teamwork, communication, creativity, critical thinking hasn’t beat creativity, leadership, emotional intelligence increased. Although, machines coming humans causing lack human-to-human interaction, humans fade little.
era, leaders. Leaders capable handling machines humans together, organized manage skilled unskilled employees providing unskilled trainees proper training. Leaders hold profound soft skills encourage teamwork working machines. patient, calm, optimized.
conclusion, machines challenging there’s humans haven’t overcome. Adaptation up-gradation primary factor survival. witness onset 4th industrial revolution, let’s buckle seats highway essential fuels (skills) eliminated. all, unending infinity end, run fuel. outdated.

provide intelligence, accelerate innovation implement technology extraordinary breadth depth global insights big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, information management organizations combining unique, specialist services high-lvel human expertise.
