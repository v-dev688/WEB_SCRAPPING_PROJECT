Introduction
“If kills 10 people decades, highly infectious virus war. missiles microbes.” Gates’s remarks conference 2014, world avoided Ebola outbreak. new, unprecedented, invisible virus hit us, met overwhelmed unprepared healthcare system oblivious population. public health emergency demonstrated lack scientific consideration underlined alarming robust innovations health medical facilities. past years, artificial intelligence proven tangible potential healthcare sectors, clinical practices, translational medical biomedical research.
detected 31st 2019, program developed BlueDot alerted world pandemic. realise AI’s ability analyse chunks data detecting patterns identifying tracking carriers virus.
tracing apps tabs people infected prevent risk cross-infection algorithms track patterns extract features classify categorise them.
that?
IBM Watson, sophisticated works computing natural language processing, prominently contributed healthcare sector global level. conversational AI, 2013, helped recommending treatments patients suffering cancer ensure treatment optimum costs.
Researchers Google Inc. showed system trained thousands images achieve physician-level sensitivity.
identifying molecular patterns disease status subtypes, expression, protein abundance levels, machine learning methods detect fatal diseases cancer stage. Machine Learning (ML) techniques focus analyzing structured data, clustering patients’ traits infer probability disease outcomes. patient traits include masses data relating age, gender, disease history, disease-specific data diagnostic imaging expressions, etc, ML extract features data inputs constructing data analytical algorithms.
ML algorithms supervised unsupervised. Unsupervised learning helps extracting features clustering similar features leads detection diseases. Clustering principal component analysis enable grouping clustering similar traits maximize minimize similarity patients clusters. patient traits recorded multiple dimensions, genes, principal component analysis(PCA) creates apparatus reduce dimensions humans alone.
Supervised learning considers outcomes subjects traits, correlates inputs outputs predict probability clinical event, expected disease level expected survival time, risk Down’s syndrome.
Biomarker panels detect ovarian cancer, outperformed conventional statistical methods due machine learning. addition this, EHRs Bayesian networks, part supervised machine learning algorithms, predict clinical outcomes mortality respectively.
Unstructured data clinical notes texts converted machine-readable structured data natural language processing(NLP). NLP works components: text processing classification. Text processing helps identifying series disease-relevant keywords clinical notes classification categorized normal abnormal cases. Chest screening ML NLP helped find abnormalities lungs provide treatment covid patients. Healthcare organizations NLP-based chatbots increase interactions patients, keeping mental health wellness check.
Deep learning modern extension classical neural network techniques helps explore complex non-linear patterns data, algorithms convolution neural network, recurrent neural network, deep belief network, deep neural network enables accurate clinical prediction. genome interpretation, deep neural networks surpass conventional methods logistics regression support vector machines.
Sepsis Watch system trained deep learning algorithms holds capability analyze 32 data points create patient’s risk score identify stages sepsis.
method Learning-based Optimization Sampling Pattern( LOUPE) based integrating full resolution MRI scans convolutional neural network algorithm, helps creating accurate reconstructions.
Robotic surgery widely considered delicate surgeries gynaecology prostate surgery. striking balance human decisions precision, robotic surgery reduces surgeon efficiency manually operated console. Thus, autonomous robotic surgery rise inventions robotic silicon fingers mimic sense touch surgeons identify organs, cut tissues, etc., robotic catheters navigate touching blood, tissue, valve.
Researchers Children’s National Hospital, developed called Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR), performs anastomosis ML-powered suturing tool, automatically detects patient’s breathing pattern apply suture correct point.
computing healthcare helped retrieving sharing medical records safely reduction maintenance costs. technology doctors healthcare workers access detailed patient data helps speeding analysis ultimately leading care form accurate information, medications, therapies.
Biomedical research?
analyze literature readability, concise biomedical research. ML algorithms NLP, accelerate screening indexing biomedical research, ranking literature interest researchers formulate test scientific hypotheses precisely quickly. Taking level, systems computational modelling assistant (CMA) helps researchers construct simulation models concepts mind. innovations majorly contributed topics tumour suppressor mechanisms protein-protein interaction information extraction.
precision medicine
precision medicine focuses healthcare interventions individuals groups patients based profile, devices pave practice efficiently. ML, complex algorithms datasets predict create optimal treatment strategy.
Deep learning neural networks process data healthcare apps watch patient’s emotional state, food intake, health monitoring.
“Omics” refers collective technologies exploring roles, relationships branches ending suffix “omics” genomics, proteomics, etc. Omics-based tests based machine learning algorithms find correlations predict treatment responses, ultimately creating personalized treatments individual patients.
helps psychology neuro patients
psychologists studying creativity, promising classes experiments developing data structures programs exploring theories horizon. Studies show conduct therapy sessions, e-therapy sessions, assessments autonomously, assisting human practitioners before, during, sessions. Detection Computational Analysis Psychological Signal project ML, computer vision, NLP analyze language, physical gestures, social signals identify cues human distress. ground-breaking technology assesses soldiers returning combat recognizes require mental health support. future, combine data captured face-to-face interviews information sleeping, eating, online behaviours complete patient view.
Stroke identification
Stroke frequently occurring disease affects 500 people worldwide. Thrombus, vessel cerebral infarction (about 85%) stroke occurrence. recent years, techniques numerous stroke-related studies detection timely treatment efficient outcome prediction solve problem. disposal, amounts data information, complications real-life clinical questions addressed arena. Currently, ML algorithms- genetic fuzzy finite machine PCA implemented build model building solution. include human activity recognition stage stroke onset detection stage. alert stroke message activated movement significantly normal pattern recorded. ML methods applied neuroimaging data assist disease evaluation predicting stroke treatment diagnosis.
Patient Monitoring
Today, market AI-based patient monitoring impressive monetarily enticing. evolving artificial sensors, technologies explores brain-computer interfaces nanorobotics. Companies smart-watches engaged people perform remote monitoring “patients”. obvious start wearable embedded sensors, glucose monitors, pulse monitors, oximeters, ECG monitors. patient monitoring crucial, finds numerous applications chronic conditions, intensive care units, operating rooms, emergency rooms, cardiac wards timeless clinical decision-making measured seconds. advances started gain traction prosthetics implants. play impeccable role patient management post-surgery rehabilitation. Demographics, laboratory results vital signs predict cardiac arrest, transfer intensive care unit, death. addition, interpretable machine-learning model assist anesthesiologists predicting hypoxaemia events surgery. suggests deep-learning algorithms, raw patient-monitoring data avoid information overload alert overload enabling accurate clinical prediction timely decision-making.
Conclusion
vast tasks do, evident holds deep potential improving patient outcomes skyrocketing levels. sophisticated algorithms bring revolution healthcare sector. facing challenges technology deliver promises, ethical measures, training physicians it, standard regulations etc, role transforming clinical practices ignored. biggest challenge integration practice. overcome period technologies mature making system enhanced effective.
provide intelligence, accelerate innovation implement technology extraordinary breadth depth global insights big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, information management organizations combining unique, specialist services high-lvel human expertise.
