Mankind now, shoots potential make 2500 AD – advent basket disruptive technologies (artificial intelligence, bio-enhancement, genetic engineering), private sector focus space exploration terraforming, fashioned human resilience. factors doubt critical human survival, pin hopes – long-demonstrated history surviving nature, universe, self-destructive tendency, throws way.

Today, LASIK surgeries obviate eyeglasses entirely. Hearing aids give gift auditory perception world muffled voices unheard sounds. iPhone routinely augmented reality tool measure length objects front us.

Artificial intelligence stuff fable, filler questions left unanswered. AI, combined bio-enhancement genetic engineering, lead evolution calling Homo nouveau3. Homo nouveau smarter, faster, agile, equipped adapt promises world VUCA imaginations. human like?

Galactic Dominance
SpaceX, led mercurial leader Elon Musk, leader here. SpaceX Programme based simple premise – earth’s closest planet terms distance terrestrial conditions, bet colonization. Musk invested billions dollars Space Programme remains fervent believer concept. tech visionaries, Musk alone. Bezos, richest world, owns Origin, simply aims make spaceflight cheaper incremental technological growth. Bezos, online retailer books turned ever-expanding behemoth, thinks small. business leaders finding spaceflight planetary colonization tantalizing prospect, inevitably concerted push developing actual colony planet. pull-factor development starts hitting diminishing returns, inevitable push factor global warming increase eruption pandemics begin toll. feasible option people find alternate home, Mars, Saturn’s moons.
human colony sounds concept science fiction, permanent station Antarctica decades ago. Everest unapproachable summit ahead planted flag peak. Today, hundreds people attempt climb. spaceflight reasonable, urge explore supersedes inertia investment, closer survival – leaving planet earth finding home, forgiving follies.
Human Spirit
introduction article includes illustrative list disasters misfortunes global community year. yet, survive. Businesses surge ahead, people adapt world masks social distancing, world on. Earthquakes, tsunamis, pandemics, we’ve survived, human race, intrepid exploration world, pushes onward upward. Technological visionaries envision future rest see, invest vision. Gradually, unthinkable suddenly – landing that. Google launched Google augmented reality wearable technology, suddenly foresee future eyewear. product didn’t catch on, doesn’t companies aren’t trying. Bio-augmentation fast-developing industry, CRISPR-Cas9, “genetic scissors” regulatory bottlenecks. prospect fiddling code luxury necessity? human spirit, tendency survive thrive costs, eventually win.
human survive 2500, doubt. question is, exists 2500, bionic chips bio-enhanced body structure modified genetic code, called Homo sapien? Homo nouveau forward?
