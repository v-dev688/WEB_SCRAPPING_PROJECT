“Machine intelligence invention humanity make”
Bostrom
put frankly, Artificial Intelligence eventually replace jobs. Workers variety industries, healthcare agriculture manufacturing, expect witness hiring disruptions result Artificial Intelligence.
history taught anything, disruptive paradigm-shifting business ideas make innovators, build groundwork business models, market entrants, job opportunities inevitably follow. robots today future eventually replace humans jobs, innovative farming equipment humans horses industrial revolution. jobs humans end here. We, hand, required generate provide ways business models result changes.
71% businesses worldwide, Artificial Intelligence people overcome critical challenging problems live lives. Artificial Intelligence consultants work equally fair, whopping 83% corporate leaders. results demonstrate Artificial Intelligence steadily extending measures, yielding societal benefits allowing citizens live fulfilling lives.
advent Industry 4.0, businesses moving automation, type industry. 2013, researchers university study future work. concluded jobs risk automated machines. Machine learning responsible disruption. powerful artificial intelligence. machines learn data mimic things humans do.
research conducted employees Kaggle algorithm created images human eye diagnose eye disease diabetic retinopathy. Here, winning algorithm match diagnosis human ophthalmologists. study conducted algorithm created grade school essays. too, winning algorithm match grade human teachers.
Thus, safely conclude data, machines easily outperform human beings tasks these. teacher 10,000 essays 40-year career; ophthalmologist 50,000 eyes machine essays eyes minutes.
Thus, convenient conclude competing machines frequent, volume tasks.
Tasks machines don’t work
tasks human beings upper hand, is, tasks. Machines can’t handle things haven’t times before. fundamental machine learning learns volumes past data. humans don’t; ability seemingly connecting disparate threads solve problems haven’t before.
physicist working radar world war 2 noticed magnetron melting chocolate bar. Here, connect understanding electromagnetic radiation knowledge cooking order invent microwave oven. sort pollination times day. Thus, machines compete tackling situations.
92% talented professionals soft skills human interactions fostering relationships matter hard skills successful managing workplace. Perhaps, kind tasks machines compete humans at.
Also, creative tasks: copy marketing campaign grab customers’ attention stand crowd. Business strategy finding gaps market working them. machines outperform humans tasks, humans creating campaigns strategies.
Human contact essential care-giving educational-related work responsibilities, technology backseat. Health screenings customer service face-to-face communication advocate human contact, Artificial Intelligence playing supporting role.
So, future work? future single job lies answer single question: extent job reducible tackling frequent high-volume tasks extent involve tackling situations?
Today machines diagnose diseases grade exam papers, coming years they’re conduct audits, they’re boilerplate legal contracts. we’re needing accountants lawyers? Wrong. We’re complex tax structuring, path breaking litigation. tougher jobs machine learning shrink ranks.
Amazon recruited 100,000 robots warehouses move goods products effectively, warehouse workforce expanded 80,000 people. Humans pick goods (Amazon 480,000,000 products “shelves”), robots move orders enormous warehouses, reducing “the amount walking required workers, making Amazon pickers efficient exhausted.” Furthermore, Amazon longer requires aisle space humans, robots enable Amazon shelves cars rush-hour traffic.” inventory offers selection customers, higher density shelf space equals inventory roof.
Kodak, undisputed giant photography industry, 90% share market 1976, 1984, employing 1,45,000 people. 2012, net negative $1 declare bankruptcy. Why? failed predict importance exponential trends technology. hand, Instagram, digital photography company started 2012 13 employees sold Facebook $1 billion. ironic Kodak pioneered digital photography invented digital camera thought mere product didn’t pay attention created problem.
live artificial intelligence (AI), tremendous computing power, storage space, information access. spinning wheel first, electricity second, computers industrial revolution exponential growth technology.
Airbnb, giant start-up enabling homeowners rent homes couches travellers, example, “is creating Artificial Intelligence system empower designers product engineers literally ideas drawing convert actual products instantly.” significant breakthrough you’re designer, engineer, type technologist.
Differences Automation brings table:
automation bring macro level:
Artificial Intelligence isn’t fad. Tractica, market research firm, published report 2016 predicted “annual global revenue artificial intelligence products services expand 643.7 2016 $36.8 2025, 57-fold increase time span.” result, industry’s fastest-growing segment size.”
reduction people result Artificial Intelligence related technologies, resulted job layoffs, fear. alone, job losses sector reportedly reached 1,000 year, owing integration advanced technologies artificial intelligence machine learning.
companies Infosys, Wipro, TCS, Cognizant reduced employee base recruiting less, engaging personnel United States investing heavily “centres innovation.” Artificial Intelligence data science, trending aspects require fewer people primarily located abroad, aren’t helping prospects local employees. factor computer industry continuously growing develop size workers. Unfortunately, it’s drop bucket compared robots Information Technology’s less-skilled brothers.
e-commerce operated armies people manned 200 robots produced GreyOrange, company based Gurgaon. indefatigable robots lift boxes 24 hours day, 30-minute break recharging, cut employees 80%. efficiency, victory disaster job prospects.
Internal re-skilling redeployment staff critical requirement hour. Artificial intelligence presented policymakers epistemological, scientific, ethical issues. requires abandon regular, linear, non-disruptive mental patterns. tale artificial intelligence’s influence individuals occupations told time. upskill ways stay current industry’s current trends demands.
So, machines jobs? answer resounding yes. However, job robots, equal number positions people do. human vocations artistic nature. necessitate humans honing superhuman cognitive abilities. Humans machines form symbiotic relationships, assisting best. future, people machines collaborate work common goal business work for.
provide intelligence, accelerate innovation implement technology extraordinary breadth depth global insights big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, information management organizations combining unique, specialist services high-lvel human expertise.
