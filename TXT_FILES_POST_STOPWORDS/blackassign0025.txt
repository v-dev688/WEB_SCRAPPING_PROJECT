2020 5th largest automobile market world. fact news automobile industry, bad news environment. How? Well, 3rd largest oil-consuming Gas (GHG) emitting nation. Assessment Report (AR6) Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change (IPCC), 2020 lockdown, complete economy shut 36 50 big cities unhealthy air quality.
Taking account current situation studies, vehicles contribute 290 Giga grams PM2, time, 8 percent total GHG (Green Gas) Emissions transport sector Delhi, exceeds 30 percent account promises made decreasing Carbon emissions NITI Ayog electrify India’s 2W segment 2025 3W segment 2030. aimed create 100 percent Electric Vehicle (EV) 2030. experts goal ambitious hybrid Electric Vehicles (EVs) Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) decade ushering goal faster fashion. give reasons it:
 basically, war Ukraine never-ending exporter crude petroleum world, rates petroleum International market skyrocketing 3rd largest oil-consuming 90 percent oil imported, lot India’s driven controlled. Moreover, lockdown people stay distance people afford personal vehicles public ones. largest market automobiles, population. effect rising oil prices (touching 100rs then) products well, transportation costs increasing inflation course.
government hoping control import EVs (Electric Vehicles) Hydrogen Running Vehicles. (no matter said, there’s India) here’s catch push increase country’s import bill. How? Well, EV components imported China, worry about, huge Automobile Industries make EVs (Electric Vehicles) completely made India, informed consumer.
let’s government issue currently:
 battery costs 70 percent total manufacturing cost EV (Electrical Vehicle), MoRTH (Ministry Road Transport Highways) ‘Battery service business model. government allotted budget 100 crores latest budget. government working applying Fame Policy spend 86 percent Consumer Incentives 10 percent Charging Infrastructure. government attract FDIs import (Lithium) make batteries. government promised build charging infrastructure.
government launched e-portal e-amrit.niti.gov COP26 Summit Glasgow. portal insight benefits EVs (Electric Vehicles). benefits talked are:
 Tailpipe Emission (ZTE) Running Cost Maintenance Tax Environmental Benefits Easy Drive
feel government adamant “ICE EV 2030” mission, let’s talk government add mission. double Dividend Hypothesis 1991 states environmentaltaxation improve economic environmental conditions recyclingrevenues obtained reduce pre-existing taxes. toll parking people EVs incentive. give tax levitation people EVs.
let’s chitchat bit problems consumers switch toEVs: driving EVs Battery Recharge Time Lack charging Infrastructure Higher cost Battery life cost commercial electricity Poor roads
forward EV future build road network isproven carbon emission ICE lesser roads driving EVs alsogreater roads.
let’s talk affect livelihood future 2040. give yousome expert’s predictions conclude article : Crew Report demand expected rise 80 percent. 75 percent vehicles EVs. Railways distances. Let’s forget air transport well. Transportation cost goods decrease Imports decrease amounts. Empty petrol stations (better converted charging stations) writing reading self-solarized EVs.
obvious (chuckles) far, share small, additional important information summarized prediction. So, EV trade route Philippines, Japan, US. extracts Ni (Nickel) batteries EVs Rio Tuba, mine, purifies makes batteries EVs. demand increasing, mining Rio Tuba increasing affecting Rainforests ecosystem, making question “Is solution?”
predict: prices nonavailability batteries parts world.
