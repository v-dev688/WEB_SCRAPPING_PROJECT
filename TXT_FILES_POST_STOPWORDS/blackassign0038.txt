AIaaS platforms DataRobot, Petuum, H2O shows expanding.AI make human workers obsolete, time put bed: robots coming jobs, yet. artificial intelligence portrayed media, favorite sci-fi movies, it’s clear advent technology created fear make human beings obsolete workforce. all, technology advanced, tasks executed human hands automated. It’s natural fear leap creating intelligent computers herald beginning end work it. But, don’t reason fatalistic. recent paper published MIT Task Force Work Future entitled “Artificial Intelligence Future Work,” looked closely developments relation world work. paper paints optimistic picture.
promoting obsolescence human labor, paper predicts continue drive massive innovation fuel existing industries potential create sectors growth, ultimately leading creation jobs. made strides replicating efficacy human intelligence executing tasks, limitations. particular, programs typically capable “specialized” intelligence, meaning solve problem, execute task time. Often, rigid, unable respond input, perform “thinking” prescribed programming. Humans, however, possess “generalized intelligence,” kind problem-solving, abstract thinking, critical judgment continue important business. Human judgment relevant, task, level sectors. factors limit runaway advancement AI. requires “learning” involve massive amounts data, calling question availability kind data, highlighting categorization issues privacy security data. limitation computation processing power. cost electricity supercharged language model estimated $4.6 million. important limitation note data bias, reflective societal inequities implicit biases designers create input data. data inputted AI, results generated AI.
introduced Congress entitled Algorithmic Accountability Act goal forcing Federal Trade Commission investigate technology potential perpetuate bias. Based factors others, MIT CCI paper argues reaching point comparable human intelligence, theoretically replace human workers entirely. Provided investment levels, education private sector governmental organizations—anywhere focuses training upskilling workers—AI potential ultimately create jobs, less. question “humans computers” “humans computers” involved complex systems advance industry prosperity. paper fascinating hoping dive deeper potential directions lead.AI standard businesses, world tech couple times recently, conversation client associate, I’m noticing fallacy people thinking it. sense phenomenon big impacts tech world. hadn’t noticed, tech world world days.
