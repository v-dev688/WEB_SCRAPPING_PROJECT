“Anything give rise smarter-than-human intelligence – form Artificial Intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement – wins hands contest change world. league.”
–Eliezer Yudkowsky, Researcher
There’s denying robots automation increasingly part lives. grocery store, highway, everywhere. makes replace human intelligence? make relevant tomorrow? find answers questions more.
Let’s understand Artificial Intelligence –
Artificial Intelligence basically machines displaying intelligence. machine playing chess robot answering questions Facebook. Artificial Intelligence broken types. AIs designed specific tasks, detecting specific type cancer. However, AIs multiple tasks, driving car. types AIs. top, important Machine Learning ML, Neural Network, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing NLP.
Machine Learning idea machines prove similar human learns skill. Machine Learning optimization existing skill. Machine Learning application entertainment. Netflix Machine Learning recommend shows watch based shows seen.
Neural Networks algorithms modeled human brain. algorithms give similar results human give. Artificial Neural Networks medical diagnose cancers lung cancer prostate cancer.
Computer Vision idea computers visions. things human beings potentially human beings do, depending programming, camera used, etc. Computer Vision autonomous vehicles navigation another.
Natural Language Processing idea computers listen say. Siri. Siri listen demands, process means, provide answer based researched.
do, Let’s talk issue.
AIs automation jobs, replacing humans do. job loss concentration wealth selected people. destabilization society social unrest. addition social unrest, improves time. smarter, faster, cheaper implement repetitive things humans do, preparing food. predicted improve 50 100 years super intelligent. smarter intelligent human earth. experts Elon Musk, end human civilization. potentially start war humans, burn crops sorts tragedies reserved human functions. point, theory, stop thought obstacles prevent goal. unplug machine, effect replace human intelligence.
But, happen 10 30 years?
NO! Artificial Intelligence sophisticated human tasks humans do. Currently, empathetic humans strategically solve complex problems. solutions expensive tests standards implement. takes time improve. example, Dynamics, world’s top robotics company robot 2009 needed assistance walk. forward 2019, robot walk jump objects, backflips more. addition timing, takes time technological solution drop point affordable. example, desktop computer costs $1000 1999 significantly powerful laptop exact price. curve.
10 30 years? make human intelligence obsolete? Maybe. proven earlier faster cheaper. happens, companies technology automate jobs save money, increase productivity, importantly, stay competitive. demonstrated, repetition machine learning. difference learn faster time progresses due amount data today. learn machines similar machines learn optimize tasks important skills. However, repetitive routine tasks better, understand emotional intelligence, ethics, creativity. distinct example- IBM
IBM IBM program create movie trailer. approached IBM movie coming #Scifi horror. asked IBM platform IBM trailer reviewing watching footage searching scary,
Sad happy moments movie provoked quality emotions based machine programmed identify emotions quantifiable manner. IBM generate trailer movie Morgan. result, movie trailer created machines – Google
2018 google demonstrated assistance calls simple stuff. set appointment! fascinating understand nuances conversation. receptionist thought human calling her. primitive version technology. Eventually, conversations human beings do, making jobs obsolete. – generated
2018, collective consisting students artificial intelligence generate portrait. generated portrait painting studying set images wiki art. estimated dollars. painting sold auction thirty-five dollars.
However, replace human intelligence. society started hard questions questioning ethics. Elon Musk founded Open AI, research lab purpose promote discover artificial intelligence benefits humanity. addition this, factors affect long-term outcome replacing human intelligence. Like, degree humans over? Depending field, people Artificial Intelligence them? prefer human counterpart? control run, secure short-term future.
Strategic creative thinking
ability human. thousands thousands slightly outcomes result distinguishable action human mind ability experience programmed purposes sophisticated manner achieve. billionaire founder Alibaba, famously – “AI logic, human beings wisdom”.
Conflict resolution negotiations
understanding complexities human-related processes ability improvise judge, equipped conflicts robots be.
recognize faces images rarely successfully feelings faces. Humans, lesser greater degrees, capable accurate analysis emotional subtext. application intuition delicately worded elusive languages, methods, properly feels.
Interpretation Areas
Robots computers function presented quantifiable data. However, situation enters area, term refers morals, processes, definitions robots falter.
Critical thinking
Humans capable responding indicators quality computers are. system analyze documents false statements made text, written analyze implication words meaning content.
