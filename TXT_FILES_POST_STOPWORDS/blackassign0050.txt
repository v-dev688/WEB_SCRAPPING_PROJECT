demand masks pandemic skyrocketing materials required production masks highly dangerous environment generally composed non-woven fabrics. Polyester, Polystyrene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, common materials surgical density lying 20grams 25 grams/sq. meter. materials resistant liquids plastic-based products afterlife discarded. treated properly discarding, end filling landfills oceans making dangerous aquatic lifeforms. example, recently environment started degrading drastically pandemic accumulation clinical wastes.

recycling plants hold, piles mountains wastes depositions open areas formed due increasing number unrecycled wastes generated day. makes surrounding vulnerable creating risk air pollutions dumped open wastes decays Methane (CH4), greenhouse gas, increasing risk global warming too. surroundings affected careless methods, local people affected. excess methane accumulated Earth’s atmosphere due piles unrecycled wastes, result increases Earth’s average temperature harmful future generations.

Likewise, time, responsible individuals step follow guideline precautions disposal waste medical gears.

Spite data showing pollutions reduced significantly pandemic, History witnessed rise pollution “post-financial crisis”. similar observed 2008 financial crash – temporary decrease emissions 1.3% observed, economy recovered 2010, emissions all-time high. all, sheer mutual empathy goodwill world emerge stronger global pandemic. prevent future outbreaks, address regularly threats ecosystems wildlife, including habitat loss, illegal trade, pollution, climate change human life depends Earth’s life.
live spacious outdoor area, desert empty road lined trees realize it’s safe, surface-less space walk in, begin realize beauty nature. point remain indoors, avoid contact others. leave home, walk desert run street, make wipe surfaces contact with, avoid touching face, frequently wash hands.
