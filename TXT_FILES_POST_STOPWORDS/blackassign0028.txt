report’s healthcare predictions 2040 are:
• Health information traditional physical check-ups tests previously surgery lab replaced data sensors on/around ‘smart’ bodies (including clothing and, eventually, skin blood). immediately accessible us, real-time.• ‘predictive medical data mining’ provide warnings physiological trouble ahead indications disease develops. Physicians 24/7 real-time reports patients’ wellbeing alerted change patients’ data requires urgent attention.• Stem-cell medicine powerful tool mainstream medicine. example, replacement human organs transplant grown demand stem cells lab, minimal risk rejection• Nano-medicine (in infancy 2019) eventually outperform branches medical science, scientists create ‘designer drugs powerful today’s drugs• Artificial Intelligence (AI) ‘chatbots’ equipped deep learning algorithms relieve emergency room personnel tending walk-in patients non-emergencies (e.g. sore throats, UTIs).
