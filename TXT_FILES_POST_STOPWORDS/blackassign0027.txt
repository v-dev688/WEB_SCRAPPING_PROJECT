Electric vehicles change today’s world. advancements technology, economies bigger. surpass #superpower, inching 15 economy 2040 competition outshine other. paradigm shift multipolar world unipolar world moving clusters world part clusters. rearrangements taking place. creating sustainable life present future generations.
witnessed COP26 leaders top countries taking pledges create sustainable future answer lies safer greener planet electric vehicles occupy huge chunk it. Internal combustion engines peaked, electric vehicles cheaper cheaper governments actively pushing electric vehicles joint statement Cop 26 “As business fleet owners operators, shared mobility platforms, work 100% car fleets emission vehicles 2030, earlier”. step future. home number two-wheelers three-wheelers constitutes 70% global 80% signatory statement. analyze properly- crude oil, coal, gas demanded natural resource world. it’s latest scenarios world, it’s #better switch safe, efficient, affordable electric vehicle.
economic aspects electric vehicles, surely improve livelihood society turn world. EVs track rise 20% China’s total market 2025, 6% 2020, 37% EU, 11% year. U.S., forecast reach 10% 2025. lagging. India’s EV market nascent forecast record 2.4% CAGR 2020 2025. Electrification expected penetrate cars last-mile connectivity modes two-wheelers 2030. expected 70% two-wheeler fleets 30% private two-wheelers electric 2030. passenger vehicles, 40% fleets 15%-20% private cars electric time. steps government #tax exemptions, schemes PLI, FAME, battery swapping policy. note estimated 10 direct jobs created indirectly 50 jobs created sector. global picture parity battery vehicles ICE vehicles advancements technology prices batteries coming players involved prices estimated down.
world leader, countries build lithium-ion batteries self-sufficient capabilities rise occasion exporters world. Union lagging catch producing batteries self-sufficient 2025.
Crude oils increasing day. shortage gas countries due Russia- Ukraine war find alternative gas crude oil harmful it’s reasons pollution havoc world. problems Crude oils oil spilling endangering species. Air pollution caused due petrol diesel vehicles affecting planet oil pollution alternative drivetrains, fuel economy, shared mobility impact oil demand; however, won’t reach net-zero 2050 more. Coal great contributor pollution Environmental impacts coal energy source particulate emission, ground-level ozone, smog, acid rain. Coal fuel oil combustion emit fly particles atmosphere, contribute air pollution problems. prices crude oil haven’t peaked yet, surely 2040. So, foresee future alternative society can’t reach complete outwash oil 2050 make alternatives self-sufficient.
Well, job opportunities reason EVs future. realize electric vehicle 350-390 km people stop recharge batteries 40-50 minutes provide time people avail restaurants explore shopping complexes not. generating employment opportunities #hubs these. countries China, USA, Union build charging stations accelerate process EV vehicles. fast, paced world alternative family car public vehicles buses trains changed electric vehicles boost economy creating greater opportunities sectors transportation communication building today’s nation-building process.
However, talking world greener fitter realize understand Electric vehicles cost planet. huge amount electric waste today’s world. concern world planning live in. Electric vehicles batteries rare materials easy find. Electronic waste, e-waste, electronic product, product electronic components, reached end usable life cycle. Unbeknownst consumers, electronics toxic substances – handled care longer wanted needed. negative effects soil improper disposal e-waste regular landfills places dumped illegally, heavy metals flame retardants seep directly e-waste soil, causing contamination underlying groundwater contamination crops planted nearby area future. Therefore, focus solely electric vehicles kinds fuels hydrogen fuels ethanol generated agricultural waste. Companies play important part change. making electric, make vehicles hybrid nature. switch engines switch petrol diesel hydrogen ethanol electric vehicles. future now…It’s time act!
