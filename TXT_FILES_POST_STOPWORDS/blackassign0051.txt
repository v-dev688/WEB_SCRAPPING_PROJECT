COVID-19 halted facing nth wave coronavirus outbreak countries, notably US, India, Brazil. fact Data Analytics big guns artillery fight COVID-19 pandemic. helped stages outbreak, detection outbreak, vaccine development manufacturing contact tracing, future hotspot detection. interesting applications discussed article.
lesser-known fact COVID-19 outbreak detected Toronto, Canada, 7,230 outbreak, days issued warning. Big Data Analytics AI, specifically Deep Learnings (DL, subset Machine Learning) application Natural Language Processing (NLP) analyze text inputs traced surge pneumonia cases Wuhan province China. specialty DL algorithms mimic cells called neurons identify patterns Big Data. DL-backed software inputs, reports public health organizations, global airline ticketing data, etc. flag unusual surges potential spreads infectious diseases.
application Big Data Analytics Research Development drugs halt COVID-19. analyze protein structure virus, findings significant progress vaccine development. preliminary studies, found mutate viruses HIV, prophylactic vaccine proceed therapy. evidence supporting fact find kind cure it, virus mutating, happened mutations found UK, Brazil, Africa. assisted scientists rapidly shortlisting set vaccines effective coronavirus.
interesting application found selection candidates, i.e. test positive testing coronavirus insufficient testing resources. method exercised Greek called project EVA. traveler wanted Greece, fill form Passenger Locator Form (PLF) 24 hours arrival, information origin country, demographics, point, date entry, intended destination. allocated testing resources size set passengers tested. test results, found positive, put quarantine. results program real-time learning.
question remains made allocations, found that, statistically, origin significant factors screening. Ultimately, variety countries pairs, predict testing resources allocated entry point passengers location technically called Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, chosen method solve problem algorithm called optimistic Gittins index. algorithm identified average 1.85x asymptomatic, infected travelers random surveillance testing, 2-4x travel. test results, found positive, put quarantine. collection significant data aforementioned process, period, policies made categorizing separately imposing restrictions travelers specific location. presented operation 6th 1st processing 38,500 PLFs testing average 18.5% households entering day.
mentioned applications show tip iceberg developments watch include Image Recognition identify covid based x-ray images, Deep Learning predict 3-D protein structure COVID-19 on.
provide intelligence, accelerate innovation implement technology extraordinary breadth depth global insights big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, information management organizations combining unique, specialist services high-lvel human expertise.
