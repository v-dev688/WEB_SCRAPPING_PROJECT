IMPACT COVID-19 ENERGY MARKETS
India, distribution utilities tariff domestic agricultural consumers, average cost supply, compared commercial industrial consumers. Table 1 electricity tariff rates selected consumer categories highlight differences. Thus, distribution companies, tariff-paying consumers cross-subsidized commercial industrial consumers.

COVID-19 lockdown led shut essential commercial activities country. Approximately 1.3 citizens obliged remain confines homes and, cases, allowed work home. Consequently, electricity demand industrial and, commercial customers reduced significantly residential demand expected increased. System Operation Corporation (POSOCO), energy met 16th, 2020 – considered business-as-usual scenario – 3494 MU compared 3113 MU 23rd, 2020 voluntary curfew. reduced 2600-2800 MU 25th 31st, 2020. trend illustrated Figure 1.
Thus, firstly, risk COVID-19 pandemic struggling distribution companies arises loss revenues due reduction demand commercial industrial customers inability cross-subsidies provided lower-tariff paying consumer. Secondly, utilities account expense comply ‘must buy’ commitments generators long-term purchase agreements. full extent risk quantitative analysis conducted crisis situation contained. Thirdly, operational level, distribution companies account deviation demand supply patterns temporal locational level. Finally, period, critical infrastructure electricity networks run minimum employees.
